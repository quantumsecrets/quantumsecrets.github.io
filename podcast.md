Welcome to the Quantum Secrets podcast, where we explore the world of quantum technologies and the people behind them. Our interviews with leaders from various quantum companies are intended to uncover valuable insights that are hard to find elsewhere.

The quantum industry is full of groundbreaking technologies that have the potential to revolutionize the world, yet there are significant challenges to overcome on the path to realizing these solutions. Our podcast takes an open and honest approach to discuss these challenges and create a culture of collaboration.

We strive to ask the questions that others may avoid, in order to foster growth and learning in the quantum community. Join us as we uncover the secrets of this rapidly evolving industry.
