Welcome to the Quantum Secrets podcast, where we dive deep into the world of quantum technologies. We're excited to bring you interviews with leaders from a variety of quantum companies, where we try to get them to tell us their secrets.

As many of you know, the quantum field is full of groundbreaking technologies and solutions that have the potential to revolutionize the world. However, there are also significant challenges and gaps that need to be addressed to make these solutions a reality. Our goal with this podcast is to ask the tough questions that many are afraid to confront, in the spirit of learning and growth.

Through open and honest dialogue with our guests, we hope to create a culture of collaboration, where we can all learn from each other and drive progress in the different quantum fields. If we don't improve how we communicate fundamental question

So, join us as we uncover the secrets of this exciting and rapidly evolving industry.
